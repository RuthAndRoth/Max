# Max – New Open Source Mesh Avatar 

The Max Avatar Project contains an Open Source mesh avatar that can
be morphed into female and male variants called “Maxine” and “Maxwell”.

Max uses completely new mesh and is not derived from Ruth2 and/or Roth2.
It is not a new version of those so a new name was adopted.  However many
of the same creators and developers are involved with Max and it is
important to maintain the current community of users in the development
and testing of Max. Hopefully this will become the seed of a community
of creators that develop clothing and other assets once the avatars and
a more reliable development kit is available.
